This assignment is extra credit (it isn’t hard, there just isn’t much time left in the semester).

Purpose: This assignment provides experience with sockets.

Start with a copy of the sock_client.c program available in the 326 directory.

As a check, compile it and run it. It should get and print the time from another machine. (The machine is named cheetah.

Modify the program to talk to the echo server on 134.139.248.3. The port number of the echo server is 7.

Send a message to the echo server, read back and print the reply. The message you send must be at least 16 characters long. (I don’t want you sending a one character message.) The reply should be the same as the message you sent.

Demo: Your modified socket program and show the instructor what you did.
